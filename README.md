# DeepBoost.jl
deep boosting algorithm implementation in Julia

Adapted from google's original c++ implementation[https://github.com/google/deepboost](https://github.com/google/deepboost) and dmarcous's c++ and R implementation [https://github.com/dmarcous/deepboost](https://github.com/dmarcous/deepboost).

### Examples
See `ionosphere_deepbost.jl` for detailed usage, it should be easy to understand.
Note that this work can do binary classification.
For multi-class deep boosting, please refer to this paper: [Multi-Class Deep Boosting](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5514-multi-class-deep-boosting)
